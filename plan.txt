- Dash resets
    - Based on if you have been on the ground for ~5 frames(?)

- Level editor
    - Autotiling (way down the line)

- Climb distance max
    - Based on how long you have been climbing up for, maybe holding does a really slow drain
    - just make counter go up while climbing up or down if climbing max hits then you cant climb any more

- wavedash
    - if u get one dash reset you can spam it forever
    - you can make yourself dash faster/farther by holding left/right while dashing

- climbing
    - cant climb over walls, u need to jump or dash over them
    - would rather it smoothly climb over like in celeste
