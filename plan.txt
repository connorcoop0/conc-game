- Dash resets
    - Based on if you have been on the ground for ~5 frames(?)

- Climb distance max
    - Based on how long you have been climbing up for, maybe holding does a really slow drain
    - just make counter go up while climbing up or down if climbing max hits then you cant climb any more

- Make some sort of ground detection for the two above
    - something that checks if youve hit the ground and refreshes climb distance and dash
    - Also should reduce self.velocity[1] to 0 to fix dashing into ground and along ground affecting jump height

- Level editor
    - Autotiling (way down the line)

- wavedash
    - if u get one dash reset you can spam it forever
    - you can make yourself dash faster/farther by holding left/right while dashing

- climbing
    - cant climb over walls, u need to jump or dash over them
    - would rather it smoothly climb over like in celeste

- FRects
    - Maybe change all Rects to FRects for easier collision and camera movement?
