Added movement + dash and simple wavedash

need to make wavedash work a little better, might be abusable or just too powerful
    - it is abusable if u get one dash reset you can spam it forever with jump+dash
    - you can make yourself dash faster/farther by holding left/right while dashing

also make jumping so you can hold it for higher jump or tap for low jump

need to add climbing

also add camera that tracks player


then we make level editor and i think we are good to make some levels
