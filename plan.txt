* Needs Implementing *
**********************
- Dying

- Loading / Resetting World
    - Create animation for it (screen black type)

- Spawners

- Autotiling

- Create 1-1 and 1-2 worlds

- Ground tile detection for walking
    - this will help to distinguish walking sounds and probably can find other uses for it (crumbling blocks, moving platforms, etc)

- Enemies?

- Particle Effects




****************
* Needs Fixing *
****************
- Cant climb over walls

- editor deletion needs to be based off of the img height/width instead of just tile size
- also add KEYS_r to reverse direction of img in editor
